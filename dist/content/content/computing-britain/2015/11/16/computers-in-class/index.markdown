As the manufacturing industries of the 1970s became the service sector
of the 1980s, the BBC tried to help democratize the coming of the
affordable microchip, to help re-equip a vulnerable workforce for a
digital future.

The BBC Computer Literacy Project was aimed initially at adults, but
somehow ended up putting a beige BBC Microcomputer in the corner of
nearly every classroom in the land.

Presented by Hannah Fry

Produced by Alex Mansfield.

'Savings with a thrill!'

In 1956, adverts enticed the British public with a brand new
opportunity. Buy premium bonds for one pound, for the chance to win a
thousand. At the time, it was a fortune - half the price of the average
house.

Behind this tantalising dream was a machine called ERNIE - the
Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment.

ERNIE was built by the team who constructed Colossus, the code-breaking
engine housed at Bletchley Park. They had just nine months to make a
machine that generated random numbers using all the latest kit, from
printed circuit boards to metal transistors.

In this episode, mathematician Hannah Fry talks to Dr Tilly Blyth from
the Science Museum about how ERNIE became an unlikely celebrity.

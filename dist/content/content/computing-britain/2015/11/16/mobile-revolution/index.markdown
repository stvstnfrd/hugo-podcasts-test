Hannah Fry tells the story of the little known British company in
Cambridge that designs and build the ARM chip, found in almost every
mobile device in the world, and the impact it has had in powering the
digital age.

The team at Acorn had designed the BBC Micro back in the early 1980s. In
an attempt to stay ahead they decided to design a new kind of
microprocessor chip, the RISC chip. They used it in the Acorn Archimedes
which was the fastest computer in the world when it was released in
1987.

After falling on hard times when the PC became the dominant computer the
company was saved when Apple chose to put the ARM chip in their personal
digital assistant, the Newton. ARM chips became ubiquitous as digital
devices became smaller.

Now they are driving the tiny devices such as the Raspberry Pi and the
BBC Micro:bit which aim to encourage young people to code, just as the
BBC Micro did three decades ago.

Hannah Fry hears the incredible story of how a chain of British teashops
produced the first office computer in the world.

J Lyons and Company was the UK's largest catering company, with 250
teashops across the country. They also owned their own bakeries, a tea
plantation and haulage firm, as Dr Tilly Blyth from the Science Museum
describes.

By the 1950s, this vast business was drowning in paperwork. Lyons
embarked on an ambitious new project to build a machine called LEO - the
Lyons Electronic Office.

Their office computer was based on the giant calculating machines being
built inside UK universities to solve mathematical equations

Sure, these machines could manage maths, but could they handle catering?

LEO Society.

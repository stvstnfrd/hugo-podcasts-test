## Use

### For your first use/podcast

1.  [Fork](https://github.com/stvstnfrd/hugo-podcasts/fork)
    this repository.
    [^fork-a-repo]
2.  Mark the new repository as a template.
    [^create-template-repo]

### For each use/podcast

1.  [Create](https://github.com/new) a new repository.
    [^create-from-template]
    - From the _Repository template_ dropdown,
      select the repository you forked in the first step.
2.  Edit the list of feeds in `./etc/feeds.opml`.
3.  Refresh your content
    - `make content`
4.  If you're also saving the artwork/media,
    - Refresh your static assets
        - `make static`
5.  Rebuild the static site.
    - `make build`
6.  Publish your site
    - `ls dist/public`

### Subscribing to a new feed

### Github Actions

There is a Workflow Action that will automatically create pull requests,
based on the provided input (feed URL, title, website).

To use the Action, you must enable the following settings
on your project settings page, under Actions/General.

- Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests
- Read and Write Permissions

Then you can use the _Subscribe to an RSS Feed_
[Workflow](actions/workflows/subscribe.yml).

#### Publish Github Pages

Before you can publish to Github Pages,
you'll need to update the _Pages Settings_:

Source
: GitHub Actions


### Advanced Use

#### Store static on another branch

Edit `lib/options.mk`:

```Makefile
# Set this to the branch where you want to store static content
GIT_BRANCH_STATIC=static
```

Then run this _once_ in the terminal:

```sh
make options_advanced
```

#### Store static on another remote repository

Edit `lib/options.mk`:

```Makefile
# Set this to the remote where you want to store static content
GIT_REMOTE_STATIC=upstream
```

Then run this _once_ in the terminal:

```sh
# URL is the remote repository,
#     eg: git@github.com:user/project.git
git remote add upstream URL
git fetch upstream
make options_advanced
```

#### Store static on another remote _and_ branch

Follow the steps above (for separate remotes and branches):

- Edit `lib/options.mk` to update both variables
- Run the shell commands from the `Remote` section;
    - you don't need to run the `Branch` section.

title: The Job Killer

---

From the earliest days of electronic computers, commentators feared that
mass unemployment would result from the efficiencies of computers and
automation in the workplace. These fears would resurface over the
decades, but came to a head towards the end of the 1970s with the coming
of relatively cheap microprocessors.

Presented by Hannah Fry

Produced by Alex Mansfield.

From the mobile phone to the office computer, mathematician Hannah Fry
looks back at 70 years of computing history, to reveal the UK's lead
role in developing the technology we use today.

In the first episode, she travels back to the 1940s, to hear the
incredible story of the creation, in Britain, of the computer memory.

Three teams from across the country - in Teddington, Manchester and
Cambridge - were tasked with designing automatic calculating engines for
university research. But which team would be first to crack the tricky
problem of machine memory?

Meanwhile, tabloid headlines proclaimed that engineers were building
'electronic brains' that could match, and maybe surpass, the human
brain, starting a debate about automation and artificial intelligence
that still resonates today.

Featuring archive from the Science Museum and the BBC Library, plus an
interview with technology historian Dr James Sumner from Manchester
University.

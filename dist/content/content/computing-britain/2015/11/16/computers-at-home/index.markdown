title: Computers at Home

---

In the 1980s, 'micro computers' invaded the home. In this episode,
Hannah Fry discovers how the computer was transported from the office
and the classroom right into our living room.

From eccentric electronics genius Clive Sinclair and his ZX80, to
smart-suited businessman Alan Sugar and the Amstrad PC, she charts the
80s computer boom - a time when the UK had more computers per head of
population than anywhere else in the world.
